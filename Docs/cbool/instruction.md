# CBOOL
By default C did not have bool or boolean Data Type(*keyword*) though we can easily use a integer varaiabel. But just to make it look better and easy for our eyes when we are working on a perticular project it is better to have a specific Data Type(*keyword*).

### How to declear :
You can declear it just how you declear a variabel for an example look bellow :
``` bool my_variable; ```

### Extra Information :
You ***false*** and ***true*** as a bool data type<br>

    false   : 0
    true    : 1
